# Read me (How to use it)
  - Download the "1.6.3_0.zip", unzip it, go to the assets folder, and open "inject.js-DFsZ8Gqk.js" in text editor
  - then replace 21070065 with the gamepass id that you own (copy id of your gamepass, and replace it)
  - load the extension in google extensions (with developer mode enabled)
  - done. (the code has not been modified, only the gamepass ids have been changed)

# Mods

# How?
- rogold checks if you own a gamepass, if you own, the freature unlocks.
